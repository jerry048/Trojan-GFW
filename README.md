Trojan-GFW is intended to be an unidentifiable mechanism to help you bypass network restrictions such as the Great Firewall (GFW). It features multiple protocols over TLS to avoid both active/passive detections and ISP QoS limitations.

### Prerequisites:

You will need a domain name and set up a DNS A record pointing to your server’s IP address. 

### Usage:

`bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry048/Trojan-GFW/main/Install.sh)`
